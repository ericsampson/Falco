## Getting Started

### Using `dotnet new`

The easiest way to get started with Falco is by installing the Falco.Template package, which adds a new template to your dotnet new command line tool:

```cmd
dotnet new -i "Falco.Template::*"
```

Afterwards you can create a new Falco application by running:

```cmd
dotnet new falco -o HelloWorldApp
```

### Manually installing

Create a new F# web project:

```cmd
dotnet new web -lang F# -o HelloWorldApp
```

Install the nuget package:

```cmd
dotnet add package Falco
```

Remove the `Startup.fs` file and save the following in `Program.fs` (if following the manual install path):

```fsharp
module HelloWorld.Program

open Falco
open Falco.Routing
open Falco.HostBuilder

let helloHandler : HttpHandler =
    "Hello world"
    |> Response.ofPlainText

[<EntryPoint>]
let main args =
    webHost args {
        endpoints [ get "/" helloHandler ]
    }
    0
```

Run the application:

```cmd
dotnet run
```

There you have it, an industrial-strength [Hello World][7] web app, achieved using only base ASP.NET Core libraries. Pretty sweet!

## Sample Applications

Code is always worth a thousand words, so for the most up-to-date usage, the [/samples][6] directory contains a few sample applications.

| Sample | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| [Hello World][7] | A basic hello world app |
| [Configure Host][21] | Demonstrating how to configure the `IHost` instance using then `webHost` computation expression |
| [Blog][17] | A basic markdown (with YAML frontmatter) blog |
| [Todo MVC][20] | A basic Todo app, following MVC style _(work in progress)_ |

## Request Handling

The `HttpHandler` type is used to represent the processing of a request. It can be thought of as the eventual (i.e. asynchronous) completion of and HTTP request processing, defined in F# as: `HttpContext -> Task`. Handlers will typically involve some combination of: route inspection, form/query binding, business logic and finally response writing.  With access to the `HttpContext` you are able to inspect all components of the request, and manipulate the response in any way you choose.

Basic request/resposne handling is divided between the aptly named [`Request`][18] and [`Response`][16] modules, which offer a suite of continuation-passing style (CPS) `HttpHandler` functions for common scenarios.

### Plain Text responses

```fsharp
let textHandler : HttpHandler =
    Response.ofPlainText "hello world"
```

### HTML responses

```fsharp
let htmlHandler : HttpHandler =
    let doc =
        Elem.html [ Attr.lang "en" ] [
            Elem.head [] [
                Elem.title [] [ Text.raw "Sample App" ]
            ]
            Elem.body [] [
                Elem.main [] [
                    Elem.h1 [] [ Text.raw "Sample App" ]
                ]
            ]
        ]

    doc
    |> Response.ofHtml
```

Alternatively, if you're using an external view engine and want to return an HTML response from a string literal you can use `Response.ofHtmlString`.

```fsharp
let htmlHandler : HttpHandler = 
    let html = "<html>...</html>"

    html
    |> Response.ofHtmlString
```


### JSON responses

> IMPORTANT: This handler uses the default `System.Text.Json.JsonSerializer`. See [JSON](#json) section below for further information.

```fsharp
type Person =
    {
        First : string
        Last  : string
    }

let jsonHandler : HttpHandler =
    { First = "John"; Last = "Doe" }
    |> Response.ofJson
```

### Set the status code of the response

```fsharp
let notFoundHandler : HttpHandler =
    Response.withStatusCode 404
    >> Response.ofPlainText "Not found"
```

### Redirect (301/302) Response (boolean param to indicate permanency)

```fsharp
let oldUrlHandler : HttpHandler =
    Response.redirect "/new-url" true
```

### Accessing route parameters

```fsharp
let helloHandler : HttpHandler =
    let getMessage (route : RouteCollectionReader) =
        route.GetString "name" "World" 
        |> sprintf "Hello %s"
        
    Request.mapRoute getMessage Response.ofPlainText
```

### Accessing query parameters

```fsharp
let helloHandler : HttpHandler =
    let getMessage (query : QueryCollectionReader) =
        query.GetString "name" "World" 
        |> sprintf "Hello %s"
        
    Request.mapQuery getMessage Response.ofPlainText
```

## Routing

The breakdown of [Endpoint Routing][3] is simple. Associate a a specific [route pattern][5] (and optionally an HTTP verb) to an `HttpHandler` which represents the ongoing processing (and eventual return) of a request.

Bearing this in mind, routing can practically be represented by a list of these "mappings" known in Falco as an `HttpEndpoint` which bind together: a route, verb and handler.

```fsharp
let helloHandler : HttpHandler =
    let getMessage (route : RouteCollectionReader) =
        route.GetString "name" "World" 
        |> sprintf "Hello %s"
        
    Request.mapRoute getMessage Response.ofPlainText

let loginHandler : HttpHandler = // ...

let loginSubmitHandler : HttpHandler = // ...  

let endpoints : HttpEndpoint list =
  [
    // a basic GET handler
    get "/hello/{name:alpha}" helloHandler

    // multi-method endpoint
    all "/login"
        [
            POST, loginSubmitHandler
            GET,  loginHandler
        ]
  ]
```

## Host Builder

[Kestrel][1] is the web server at the heart of ASP.NET. It's a performant, secure and maintained by incredibly smart people. Getting it up and running is usually done using `Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)`, but it can grow verbose quickly. To make things a little cleaner, Falco exposes an optional computation expression. Below is an example using the builder, taken from the [Configure Host][21] sample.

```fsharp
module ConfigureHost.Program

open Falco
open Falco.Markup
open Falco.Routing
open Falco.HostBuilder
open Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder
open Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting
open Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection
open Microsoft.Extensions.Logging

// ... rest of startup code

let configureHost (endpoints : HttpEndpoint list) (webhost : IWebHostBuilder) =
    // definitions omitted for brevity
    webhost.ConfigureLogging(configureLogging)
           .ConfigureServices(configureServices)
           .Configure(configureApp endpoints)

[<EntryPoint>]
let main args =
    webHost args {
        configure configureHost
        endpoints [
                      get "/" ("hello world" |> Response.ofPlainText)
                  ]
    }
    0
```

## Model Binding

Binding at IO boundaries is messy, error-prone and often verbose. Reflection-based abstractions tend to work well for simple use cases, but quickly become very complicated as the expected complexity of the input rises. This is especially true for an algebraic type system like F#'s. As such, it is often advisable to take back control of this process from the runtime. An added bonus of doing this is that it all but eliminates the need for `[<CLIMutable>]` attributes.

We can make this simpler by creating a succinct API to obtain typed values from `IFormCollection`, `IQueryCollection`, `RouteValueDictionary` and `IHeaderCollection`. _Readers_ for all four exist as derivatives of `StringCollectionReader` which is an abstraction intended to make it easier to work with the string-based key/value collections.

### Route Binding

Route binding will normally achieved through `Request.mapRoute` or `Request.bindRoute` if you are concerned with handling bind failures explicitly. Both are continuation-style handlers, which expose an opportunity to project the values from `RouteCollectionReader`, which also has full access to the query string via `QueryCollectionReader`.

```fsharp
let mapRouteHandler : HttpHandler =
    let routeMap (route : RouteCollectionReader) = route.GetString "Name" "John Doe"
    
    Request.mapRoute
        routeMap
        Response.ofJson

let bindRouteHandler : HttpHandler = 
    let routeBind (route : RouteCollectionReader) =
        match route.TryGetString "Name" with
        | Some name -> Ok name
        | _         -> Error {| Message = "Invalid route" |}
    
    Request.bindRoute
        routeBind
        Response.ofJson // handle Ok
        Response.ofJson // handle Error

let manualRouteHandler : HttpHandler =
    fun ctx ->
        let route = Request.getRoute ctx
        let name = route.GetString "Name" "John Doe"
        
        // You also have access to the query string
        let q = route.Query.GetString "q" "{default value}"
        Response.ofJson name ctx
```

### Query Binding

Query binding will normally achieved through `Request.mapQuery` or `Request.bindQuery` if you are concerned with handling bind failures explicitly. Both are continuation-style handlers, which expose an opportunity to project the values from `QueryCollectionReader`.

```fsharp
type Person = { FirstName : string; LastName : string }

let mapQueryHandler : HttpHandler =    
    Request.mapQuery
        (fun rd -> { 
            FirstName = rd.GetString "FirstName" "John" // Get value or return default value
            LastName = rd.GetString "LastName" "Doe" 
        })
        Response.ofJson 

let bindQueryHandler : HttpHandler = 
    Request.bindQuery 
        (fun rd -> 
            match rd.TryGetString "FirstName", rd.TryGetString "LastName" with
            | Some f, Some l -> Ok { FirstName = f; LastName = l }
            | _  -> Error {| Message = "Invalid query string" |})
        Response.ofJson // handle Ok
        Response.ofJson // handle Error

let manualQueryHandler : HttpHandler =
    fun ctx ->
        let query = Request.getQuery ctx
        
        let person = 
            { 
                FirstName = query.GetString "FirstName" "John" // Get value or return default value
                LastName = query.GetString "LastName" "Doe" 
            }

        Response.ofJson person ctx
```

### Form Binding

Form binding will normally achieved through `Request.mapForm` or `Request.bindForm` if you are concerned with handling bind failures explicitly. Both are continuation-style handlers, which expose an opportunity to project the values from `FormCollectionReader`, which also has full access to the `IFormFilesCollection` via the `_.Files` member.

> Note the addition of `Request.mapFormSecure` and `Request.bindFormSecure` which will automatically validate CSRF tokens for you.

```fsharp
type Person = { FirstName : string; LastName : string }

let mapFormHandler : HttpHandler =    
    Request.mapForm
        (fun rd -> { 
            FirstName = rd.GetString "FirstName" "John" // Get value or return default value
            LastName = rd.GetString "LastName" "Doe" 
        })
        Response.ofJson 

let mapFormSecureHandler : HttpHandler =    
    Request.mapFormSecure
        (fun rd -> { 
            FirstName = rd.GetString "FirstName" "John" // Get value or return default value
            LastName = rd.GetString "LastName" "Doe" 
        })
        Response.ofJson 
        (Response.withStatusCode 400 >> Response.ofEmpty)

let bindFormHandler : HttpHandler = 
    Request.bindForm 
        (fun rd -> 
            match rd.TryGetString "FirstName", rd.TryGetString "LastName" with
            | Some f, Some l -> Ok { FirstName = f; LastName = l }
            | _  -> Error {| Message = "Invalid form data" |})
        Response.ofJson // handle Ok
        Response.ofJson // handle Error

let bindFormSecureHandler : HttpHandler = 
    Request.bindFormSecure
        (fun rd -> 
            match rd.TryGetString "FirstName", rd.TryGetString "LastName" with
            | Some f, Some l -> Ok { FirstName = f; LastName = l }
            | _  -> Error {| Message = "Invalid form data" |})
        Response.ofJson // handle Ok
        Response.ofJson // handle Error
        (Response.withStatusCode 400 >> Response.ofEmpty)

let manualFormHandler : HttpHandler =
    fun ctx -> task {
        let! query = Request.getForm ctx
        
        let person = 
            { 
                FirstName = query.GetString "FirstName" "John" // Get value or return default value
                LastName = query.GetString "LastName" "Doe" 
            }

        return! Response.ofJson person ctx
    }        
```

## JSON

Included in Falco are basic JSON in/out handlers, `Request.bindJson` and `Response.ofJson` respectively. Both rely on `System.Text.Json`, thus without support for F#'s algebraic types.

```fsharp
type Person =
    {
        First : string
        Last  : string
    }

let jsonHandler : HttpHandler =
    { First = "John"; Last = "Doe" }
    |> Response.ofJson

let jsonBindHandler : HttpHandler =    
    Request.bindJson
        (fun person -> Response.ofPlainText (sprintf "hello %s %s" person.First person.Last))
        (fun error -> Response.withStatusCode 400 >> Response.ofPlainText (sprintf "Invalid JSON: %s" error))
```

## Markup

A core feature of Falco is the XML markup module. It can be used to produce any form of angle-bracket markup (i.e. HTML, SVG, XML etc.). 

For example, the module is easily extended since creating new tags is simple. An example to render `<svg>`'s:

```fsharp
let svg (width : float) (height : float) =
    Elem.tag "svg" [
        Attr.create "version" "1.0"
        Attr.create "xmlns" "http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
        Attr.create "viewBox" (sprintf "0 0 %f %f" width height)
    ]

let path d = Elem.tag "path" [ Attr.create "d" d ] []

let bars =
    svg 384.0 384.0 [
            path "M368 154.668H16c-8.832 0-16-7.168-16-16s7.168-16 16-16h352c8.832 0 16 7.168 16 16s-7.168 16-16 16zm0 0M368 32H16C7.168 32 0 24.832 0 16S7.168 0 16 0h352c8.832 0 16 7.168 16 16s-7.168 16-16 16zm0 0M368 277.332H16c-8.832 0-16-7.168-16-16s7.168-16 16-16h352c8.832 0 16 7.168 16 16s-7.168 16-16 16zm0 0"
        ]
```

### HTML View Engine

Most of the standard HTML tags & attributes have been built into the markup module, which produce objects to represent the HTML node. Nodes are either:
- `Text` which represents `string` values. (Ex: `Text.raw "hello"`, `Text.rawf "hello %s" "world"`)
- `SelfClosingNode` which represent self-closing tags (Ex: `<br />`).
- `ParentNode` which represent typical tags with, optionally, other tags within it (Ex: `<div>...</div>`).

The benefits of using the Falco markup module as an HTML engine include:

- Writing your views in plain F#, directly in your assembly.
- Markup is compiled alongside the rest of your code, leading to improved performance and ultimately simpler deployments.

```fsharp
// Create an HTML5 document using built-in template
let doc = 
    Templates.html5 "en"
        [ Elem.title [] [ Text.raw "Sample App" ] ] // <head></head>
        [ Elem.h1 [] [ Text.raw "Sample App" ] ]    // <body></body>
```

Since views are plain F# they can easily be made strongly-typed:
```fsharp
type Person =
    {
        First : string
        Last  : string
    }

let doc (person : Person) = 
    Elem.html [ Attr.lang "en" ] [
            Elem.head [] [                    
                    Elem.title [] [ Text.raw "Sample App" ]                                                            
                ]
            Elem.body [] [                     
                    Elem.main [] [
                            Elem.h1 [] [ Text.raw "Sample App" ]
                            Elem.p  [] [ Text.rawf "%s %s" person.First person.Last ]
                        ]
                ]
        ]
```

Views can also be combined to create more complex views and share output:
```fsharp
let master (title : string) (content : XmlNode list) =
    Elem.html [ Attr.lang "en" ] [
            Elem.head [] [                    
                    Elem.title [] [ Text.raw "Sample App" ]                                                            
                ]
            Elem.body [] content
        ]

let divider = 
    Elem.hr [ Attr.class' "divider" ]

let homeView =
    [
        Elem.h1 [] [ Text.raw "Homepage" ]
        divider
        Elem.p  [] [ Text.raw "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing."]
    ]
    |> master "Homepage" 

let aboutView =
    [
        Elem.h1 [] [ Text.raw "About" ]
        divider
        Elem.p  [] [ Text.raw "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing."]
    ]
    |> master "About Us"
```

## Authentication

ASP.NET Core has amazing built-in support for authentication. Review the [docs][13] for specific implementation details. Falco optionally (`open Falco.Auth`) includes some authentication utilites.

> To use the authentication helpers, ensure the service has been registered (`AddAuthentication()`) with the `IServiceCollection` and activated (`UseAuthentication()`) using the `IApplicationBuilder`. 

- Prevent user from accessing secure endpoint:

```fsharp
open Falco.Security

let secureResourceHandler : HttpHandler =
    let handleAuth : HttpHandler = 
        "hello authenticated user"
        |> Response.ofPlainText 

    let handleInvalid : HttpHandler =
        Response.withStatusCode 403 
        >> Response.ofPlainText "Forbidden"

    Request.ifAuthenticated handleAuth handleInvalid
```

- Prevent authenticated user from accessing anonymous-only end-point:

```fsharp
open Falco.Security
 
let anonResourceOnlyHandler : HttpHandler =
    let handleAnon : HttpHandler = 
        Response.ofPlainText "hello anonymous"

    let handleInvalid : HttpHandler = 
        Response.withStatusCode 403 
        >> Response.ofPlainText "Forbidden"

    Request.ifNotAuthenticated handleAnon handleInvalid
```

- Allow only user's from a certain group to access endpoint"
```fsharp
open Falco.Security

let secureResourceHandler : HttpHandler =
    let handleAuthInRole : HttpHandler = 
        Response.ofPlainText "hello admin"

    let handleInvalid : HttpHandler = 
        Response.withStatusCode 403 
        >> Response.ofPlainText "Forbidden"

    // Option 1
    let rolesAllowed = ["Admin"; "SuperUser"]
    Request.ifAuthenticatedInRole rolesAllowed handleAuthInRole handleInvalid

    // Option 2
    let rolesAllowed = Admin | SuperUser
    Request.ifAuthenticatedInRole rolesAllowed handleAuthInRole handleInvalid

     // Option 2b (reduced overhead)
    [<Struct>]
    type rolesAllowed = Admin | SuperUser
        with override this.ToString() =
                match this with
                | Admin     -> "Admin"
                | SuperUser -> "SuperUser"
        
    Request.ifAuthenticatedInRole rolesAllowed handleAuthInRole handleInvalid
```

- End user session (sign out):

```fsharp
open Falco.Security

let logOut : HttpHandler =         
    let authScheme = "..."
    let redirectTo = "/login"

    Response.signOutAndRedirect authScheme redirectTo
```

## Security

Cross-site scripting attacks are extremely common, since they are quite simple to carry out. Fortunately, protecting against them is as easy as performing them. 

The [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Antiforgery][14] package provides the required utilities to easily protect yourself against such attacks.

Falco provides a few handlers via `Falco.Security.Xss`:

> To use the Xss helpers, ensure the service has been registered (`AddAntiforgery()`) with the `IServiceCollection` and activated (`UseAntiforgery()`) using the `IApplicationBuilder`. 

```fsharp
open Falco.Security 

let formView (token : AntiforgeryTokenSet) =     
    Elem.html [] [
        Elem.body [] [
            Elem.form [ Attr.method "post" ] [
                Elem.input [ Attr.name "first_name" ]

                Elem.input [ Attr.name "last_name" ]

                // using the CSRF HTML helper
                Xss.antiforgeryInput token

                Elem.input [ Attr.type' "submit"; Attr.value "Submit" ]
            ]                                
        ]
    ]
    
// A handler that demonstrates obtaining a
// CSRF token and applying it to a view
let csrfViewHandler : HttpHandler = 
    formView
    |> Response.ofHtmlCsrf
    
// A handler that demonstrates validating
// the requests CSRF token
let mapFormSecureHandler : HttpHandler =    
    let mapPerson (form : FormCollectionReader) =
        { FirstName = form.GetString "first_name" "John" // Get value or return default value
          LastName = form.GetString "first_name" "Doe" }

    let handleInvalid : HttpHandler = 
        Response.withStatusCode 400

### Crytography

Many sites have the requirement of a secure log in and sign up (i.e. registering and maintaining a user's database). Thus, generating strong hashes and random salts is of critical importance. 

Falco helpers are accessed by importing `Falco.Auth.Crypto`.

```fsharp
open Falco.Security

// Generating salt,
// using System.Security.Cryptography.RandomNumberGenerator,
// create a random 16 byte salt and base 64 encode
let salt = Crypto.createSalt 16 

// Generate random int for iterations
let iterations = Crypto.randomInt 10000 50000

// Pbkdf2 Key derivation using HMAC algorithm with SHA256 hashing function
let password = "5upe45ecure"
let hashedPassword = password |> Crypto.sha256 iterations 32 salt
``` 

## Handling Large Uploads

Microsoft defines [large uploads][15] as anything **> 64KB**, which well... is most uploads. Anything beyond this size, and they recommend streaming the multipart data to avoid excess memory consumption.

To make this process **a lot** easier Falco exposes an `HttpContext` extension method `TryStreamFormAsync()` that will attempt to stream multipart form data, or return an error message indicating the likely problem.

```fsharp
let imageUploadHandler : HttpHandler =
    fun ctx -> task {
        let! form = Request.tryStreamFormAsync()
            
        // Rest of code using `FormCollectionReader`
        // ...
    }
```

## Why "Falco"?

[Kestrel][1] has been a game changer for the .NET web stack. In the animal kingdom, "Kestrel" is a name given to several members of the falcon genus. Also known as "Falco".
